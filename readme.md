# Example Middle School Database

## Description

This project is a simple database system designed for managing information related to a middle school. It allows users to store and retrieve data about students, teachers, classes, and grades, enabling more efficient management of school operations. The system also includes a **Streamlit GUI** for easy interaction with the database, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via a web interface.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Faculty Management**: Manage Faculty information.
- **Enrollment Management**: Organize enrollments with details on rooms and teachers.
- **Streamlit GUI**: A web-based interface that simplifies interaction with the database, making it user-friendly and intuitive.
